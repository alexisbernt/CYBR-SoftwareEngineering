## 4.2 - Planning

#### Executive Summary
- **Problem** - Many Windows users have no backup, or a disorganized backup, of their computer files.
- **Process to Solve the Problem** - The problem is addressed by introducing a workflow that utilizes a USB drive and backup software to streamline file compression and storage to a designated backup destination. See workflow here: [Workflow](https://github.com/jschnell13/StealthElf/blob/main/Documentation/Workflow.md) <br>
- **Proposed Solution** - A backup software that zips and then stores selected folders onto a USB drive.
- **Expected Deliverables** - A backup software, a CSV file that stores the user's presets
  
#### Statement of Work
- **Project Objectives** -  To successfully create a backup software that fulfils the inherant requirements of our scope.
- **Scope** - In short, our scope is to create a command line program that allows the Window's user to backup their files. This program will include an option to save preset backup folders and locations. Our scope is defined more precisely by our worklow document: [Workflow](https://github.com/jschnell13/StealthElf/blob/main/Documentation/Workflow.md) <br>
- **Expectations of the Team upon Completion** - Upon completion, our team hopes to have successfully created a backup software and accompanying document whist following the waterfall SDLC.

#### Problem Statement
- **Problem** -  Many Window's users have no backup, or a disorganized backup, of their computer files.
- **Why a solution is needed** - In the current age of digital technology, it is vital that user's have a backup of their important documents. Furthermore, an organized and centralized backup allows for ease of use and efficiency in file retrieval.
- **What void is being filled** - The void filled is a lack of free, easy-to-use backup software.
- **Who will use your system** - Our system will be utilized by Window's users who wish to backup their files.

#### Timeline

#### Outcome Summary
- **Outcome Summary** - Our expected outcome is best described by a program that meets the requirements of our workflow. Workflow: [Workflow](https://github.com/jschnell13/StealthElf/blob/main/Documentation/Workflow.md) <br>

#### Security Statement
- **Security Statement** - Due to the limited scope of our project, our security goals are closely aligned with ensuring that the user can only input valid options. For menu options, the only accepted input will be a menu option. For files and folders, the program will validate the user's input. For creating presets, the program will ensure that the preset doesn't already exist. For deleting presets, the program will validate that the preset does indeed exist prior to deletion.
