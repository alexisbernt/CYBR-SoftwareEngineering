Your client has asked you to design a web scraper to capture online search data. The use case is as follows: 
A user will open the program and enter a website they would like to search along with a search term. After taking user input, the program will scrape the website html code 
finding each occurrence of the term. Each time the term is found, the web scraper will save the current URL and the context of the term (the <div> or <p> the term is in). 
After completion, the user will be shown a list of each term occurrence with clickable links to visit the locations of the term.
